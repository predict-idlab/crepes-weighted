# crepes-weighted

`crepes-weighted` is an extension of [`crepes`](https://github.com/henrikbostrom/crepes), a Python package that implements conformal classifiers,
regressors, and predictive systems on top of any standard classifier
and regressor. `crepes-weighted` extends `crepes` by adding support for weighted conformal prediction and predictive systems, in the future this could potentially be merged into the main `crepes` package.
